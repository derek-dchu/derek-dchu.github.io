When working on a team project, I keep thinking about how can my teammates and I work in a more effective manner. In software engineering, software development lifecycle (SDLC) provides such guidance for us. It is a division of software development work into distinct phases or activities. Associated with SDLC, there are many different models have been created based on day-by-day software development experience. A SDLC model is liked a framework of processes used to create a software product from requirements analysis to maintenance.

Big Bang Model is one frequently used model. It is not because of the reliability of delivering good software product, but its simplicity that is a good learning aid for students or new programmers.  It is an ideal start point for academic or practice projects. Let me explain it more.

There is no formal development process and very little planning is required in Big Bang Model. Usually, the development will start with all possible resources and end up either the perfect software product or disaster. Because, under this model, developers put all their efforts on writing perfect code in individual component, and lack of general planning, scheduling in a team. Eventually, the team may have fully functional modules but cannot integrate them together because of different of API or ever changing individual development.

However, simplicity becomes a benefit for students that they can focus on writing good code and get familiar with SDLC. They will eventually searching for other models and acknowledge the importance of selecting an appropriate model for their project.
