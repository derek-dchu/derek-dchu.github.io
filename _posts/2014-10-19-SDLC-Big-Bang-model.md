When working on a team project, I keep thinking about how can my teammates and I work in a more effective manner. In software engineering, software development lifecycle (SDLC) provides such guidance for us. It is a division of software development work into distinct phases or activities. Associated with SDLC, there are different models have been created based on day-by-day software development experience. A SDLC model is liked a framework of processes used to create a software product from requirements analysis to maintenance.

Big Bang Model is one frequently used model. It is not because of the reliability of delivering good software product, but its simplicity. It is not a good fit for complex, long and ongoing projects. However, it is an ideal start point for academic or practice projects. Let me explain it more.

The general idea of Big Bang Model is that, there is no formal development process and no or little planning is required. Usually, the development will start with all possible resources and end up either the perfect software product or disaster. Because, under this model, developers put all their efforts on writing perfect code of individual component, and lack of overall planning, scheduling and communication in a team. Eventually, the team may have fully functional modules but cannot integrate them together because of API disagreement or ever changing individual development.

Nevertheless, simplicity becomes a benefit for students, so that they can focus on writing good code while getting familiar with SDLC. They will eventually acknowledge the importance of selecting an appropriate SDLC model and start learning other models for their projects.

Let's finish this post with an overview of pros and cons.

{:.pure-table}
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Very Simple | Very High uncertainty |
| No or little planning required | Poor for complex and object-oriented projects |
| Good for learning SDLC | Become disaster when things don't work out
